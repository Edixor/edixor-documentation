# Why Edixor?

**Edixor** is a toolset built for the Unity Editor, designed to improve the quality and efficiency of plugin, asset, and extension development.

## How Can Edixor Help?

Edixor offers enhanced versions of Unity's custom editor windows, including:

- **[EdixorWindow](edixor/window.md)** — custom window with extended features
- **[EdixorInspector](edixor/inspection.md)** — powerful inspector replacement

Compared to standard Unity windows and inspectors, these tools provide:

- Extended functionality
- Deep customization options

## Custom Content (if you don't use full windows)

Even if you don't use EdixorWindow or EdixorInspector, Edixor also provides flexible editor-integrated components:

- **[Menu](custom/menu.md)**
- **[Enum](custom/enum.md)**
- **[Hint](custom/hint.md)**
- **[Warning Window](custom/warning-window.md)**

These components integrate directly into the Unity Editor and are fully customizable — including appearance and behavior. They can offer significant functionality improvements over standard UI.

## Built-in Documentation System

Edixor also provides a documentation system that is deeply integrated into the Unity Editor, allowing your users to access help and information directly within Unity.
