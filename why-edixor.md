# Why Edixor?

## Why Edixor?

**Edixor** is a toolset built for the Unity Editor, designed to improve the quality and efficiency of plugin, asset, and extension development.

***

### How Can Edixor Help?

Edixor offers enhanced versions of Unity's custom editor windows, including:

* **EdixorWindow** — custom window with extended features
* **EdixorInspector** — powerful inspector replacement

Compared to standard Unity windows and inspectors, these tools provide:

* Extended functionality
* Deep customization options

***

### Custom Content (if you don't need full windows)

Even if you don't use EdixorWindow or EdixorInspector, Edixor also provides flexible editor-integrated components:

* **Menu**
* **Enum**
* **Hint**
* **Warning Window**

These components integrate directly into the Unity Editor and are fully customizable — including appearance and behavior. They can offer significant functionality improvements over standard UI.

### Built-in Documentation System

Edixor also provides a documentation system that is deeply integrated into the Unity Editor, allowing your users to access help and information directly within Unity.\
